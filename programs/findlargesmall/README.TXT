prompt the user for 6 integers

set the first 2 integers to small and large

if the integer 1 is greater than integer 2
    set small to integer 2
    set large to integer 1
else
    set small to integer 1
    set large to integer 2
    
create count and set equal to 3

while the count is less than or equal to 6
    prompt the user for the next integer
    
    while the input is greater than the next integer
        set small equal to that integer
        
    while the input is smaller than the next integer
        set large eqal to that integer
        
    increase the count by 1 each time the loop executes
    
print out the final values for large and small
